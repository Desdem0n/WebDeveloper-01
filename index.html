   <h1 class="title">Green eyes</h1> 
   <p>Since I saw you
    I can't eat, I can't sleep
    How did this happen, I do not know?
    Love made itself known
    
    What can I do about it
    That love came just today.
    That summer is in my heart,
    and in my thoughts is you
    
    Through your eyes, these green eyes are crazy!
    I think the stars gave all their glow.
    And I gave you my thirsty love heart
    You can fall in love with it only once
    
    In my arms he will hide you
    I will lay the whole world at your feet.
    My heart is beating for you
    And waiting for your little sign
    One smile is enough
    And my heart loses rhythm
    I will fight for your love
    It's not a shame to fight for love
    
    Through your eyes, these green eyes have gone mad
    Stars I think they gave your eyes all the glow
    And I gave you my thirsty love heart
    You can fall in love with it only once</p>
